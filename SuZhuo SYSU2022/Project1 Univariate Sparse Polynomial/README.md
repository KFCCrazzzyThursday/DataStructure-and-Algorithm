# Project1 Univariate Sparse Polynomial

Author: 21307099 Li Yingjun

## Introduction

This project implements a text statistics program designed to perform various operations on polynomial expressions. The functionalities include adding, subtracting, multiplying, and deriving polynomials, printing them in descending powers, and robust error handling for invalid inputs.

## Features

- Input and store polynomials automatically in the order of p1, p2, p3, etc.
- Perform binary operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and derivation on stored polynomials.
- Print all stored polynomials in descending powers.
- Modify the value of a stored polynomial.
- Clear all stored polynomials.
- Free up memory and exit the program.
- The program has a strong ability to recognize illegal data entry.

## Usage

1. Input the polynomial expressions as prompted by the program.
2. Choose the operation you want to perform (addition, subtraction, multiplication, derivative calculation).
3. To modify a polynomial, enter the correct polynomial reference as indicated by the program.
4. To evaluate a polynomial, input the value of x and the program calculates the result.
5. To print all polynomials, simply input the designated command.
6. To clear the memory or exit, follow the prompted instructions.

## Update Log

- The evaluation functionality has been added post initial demonstrations due to its prior omission.

## Code Execution

Before running the code, ensure you have the correct environment to compile and execute a C++ program. This project is created with Visual Studio 2022 and may not be backward compatible with older versions.
